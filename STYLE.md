# Style Guidelines

One goal of mine is to learn how to create an organized webapp. \
It seems to me that a lot of times there are various pieces of \
data hardcoded across multiple files in order to get different \
components to work. I think we should strive to make style \
elements reusable.


## Color Scheme

I think having a nice neutral color scheme would fit well with the \
newspaper asthetic we already all are used to as well as some \
colors that really pop for data visualization. Here are some \
initial suggestions.

### Normal Colors
The background and text colors are decent but the other neutrals \
could use some work.
- Background: #ECECDF (Alabaster)
- Text: #2E2E2E (Jet)
- Neutral 1: #7E6551 (Coyote)
- Neutral 2: #668F80 (Viridian)
- Neutral 3: #7D8491 (Slate Gray)
- Neutral 4: #71816D (Reseda Green)
- Neutral 5: #C2C299 (Sage)


### Data Visualization
Two base colors used; think of these as true/false:
- #FF3366 (Folly)
- #20A4F4 (Celestial Blue)
